In this report, we will do some analysis on the PasturedPoultryFarms dataset comprising of samples taken in different farms from
different animal sources. The PasturedPolutryFarms contains three tabs: Broilers, FecalSoil, Compositional

We would like to answer these five questions using generalized linear regression
analysis:

1. Are Camplyobacter, Salmonella, and Listeria in the Broilers tab predictive of each other.
2. Model the probability of Camplyobacter in terms of the Type and Month variable in the Broliers tab
3. Model the variable EcoliLog10 in terms of the Type and Month variable
4. Are Farm and Flock needed to be controlled to answer the previous two research questions.
5. Can both the SampleType and PastureTime be predicted using the proportion of bacteria found?
If not, can the SampleType alone be predicted using using the proportion of bacteria found?
