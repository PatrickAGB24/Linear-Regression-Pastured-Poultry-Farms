In this report, we will do some analysis on the PasturedPoultryFarms dataset comprising of samples taken in different farms from
different animal sources. The PasturedPolutryFarms contains three tabs: _Broilers_, _FecalSoil_, _Compositional_

We would like to answer these five questions using generalized linear regression
analysis:

1. Are _Camplyobacter_, _Salmonella_, and _Listeria_ in the _Broilers_ tab predictive of each other.
2. Model the probability of _Camplyobacter_ in terms of the _Type_ and _Month_ variable in the _Broliers_ tab
3. Model the variable _EcoliLog10_ in terms of the _Type_ and _Month_ variable in the _FecalSoil_ tab
4. Are _Farm_ and _Flock_ needed to be controlled to answer the previous two research questions.
5. Can both the _SampleType_ and _PastureTime_ be predicted using the proportion of bacteria found in the _Compositional_ tab?
If not, can the _SampleType_ alone be predicted using the proportion of bacteria found in the _Compositional_ tab?
